      <!-- <p>The term "object-oriented program" is essentially meaningless.Object-oriented programming applies to high-level source code, notto programs.</p> -->
      <p>I'm proficient with Microsoft Office suite including Word, Excel, and Power Point. I'm very comfortable using these programs and have a lot of experience doing so. </p>
      <p>I am familiar with using both Windows and Apple operating software. I have used both in my previous job for the past ten years.</p>
      <p>I did not work with Java at my previous job, I am currently taking an online course in which I am learning Java. I am already halfway through the course, and am quickly gaining confidence in this program. I have taken other online courses to strengthen my IT skills, and have had much success.</p>
